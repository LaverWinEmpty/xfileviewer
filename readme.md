# X File Viewer

## DirectX 9.0

I refactored the code that was implemented in the past.

That's why the structure is strange.

Can use it by calling Core::Run().

The file is located at /core/core/core.hpp.

The docs.txt file is completely empty.

Load the x file and texture file using the Windows GUI.

And the texture load will repeat as many times as necessary.

## How To Use

Mouse L Button: Rotate

Mouse R Button: Move

Mouse Wheel Up/Down: Scale Up/Down
